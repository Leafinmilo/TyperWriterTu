You may be interested to see the [Buddhist interpretation]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-03-30-Iroha-bu %}).

In fact, it would be better to view that first.

To some extend, <b>the nature of this post is speculative</b>. And I will accept that criticism.  

## Christianic interpretation

### Forward
Now, it is important to know that.
1. I am not someone who has attended theological seminary school. For that, please forgive me if I utter things wrongly.
2. Christianity is a big topic, and people have various opinions about it. As far as this is concerned, I am a Protestant. For that, please understand that our viewpoints may be different.
3. I cannot say I am a good follower in any way. For that, please forgive me if I utter things that may not be accurate.
4. I strongly believe that the Buddhist monks of old would have encountered Christianity in one form or another, and some of the monks may either have become followers of Christ themselves or integrate Christian understanding into their teachings because they find the thought process of the Bible to be fascinating (particularly Psalms). 
6. In Manyogana, I don't think the words for Iroha Poem really mean anything. 
7. I am not trying to push any religion to you, nor is it my aim to insult anyone. 

[SKIP history of Christianity](#why-christianic-interpretation)

## Clarification on 
### What Christianity means

First of all, Christianity is not a western religion. But it has been spread by the western countries due to colonialism and stuff. 

This is slightly problematic, because Jesus is often depicted:
1. with a face. This tradition is maybe helpful, but really problematic. 
2. as a white male. Which is very interesting when you see paintings of Jesus in classical Chinese art style. For example:

![Chinese depiction of Jesus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/ChineseJesus.jpg)

(Image Source: [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ChineseJesus.jpg))

### The message of Christianity

Christianity is a religion that believes that the promise given by GOD in the Old Testament, which Judaism is based on, is fulfilled  by Jesus who is recognized to be The Christ -that is, the Savior.

Besides Jesus Christ being the fulfillment of the Old Testament, Christianity also marks the beginning where the message of GOD is to be shared to non-Jew (the Gentiles). 

### The Bible

I would not be talking much about the Christian Bible, however three things:
1. The Bible is widely accepted to have only been compiled in the 5th Century.
2. Catholics and Protestants have different types of Bibles. Namely, the Protestants have the 39 Old Testament and 27 New Testament, whereas the Catholic as 39 OT + extra and 27 NT. Some Protestant denomination have additional books, which may or may not be added to their versions of the Bible.
3. The Bible is not originally in English, but in Hebrew and Arabic. Some information is lost in translation. Frankly speaking, the Muslims got it right in having people learn Arabic to understand the Qur'an, but that is a different story all together.

### Protestants and Catholics

Strictly speaking, the word Catholic means 'Universal' (i.e. the big C Church as apposed to small c church).

Anyway. According to Lactantius, Constantine the Great (approx 300 AD) received a sign `Chi Ro`, which led him win the wars and made him emperor. This sign `Chi Ro` was the first two letters of the word `Christos` which means Christ (i.e. Jesus Christ). 

This marked the first Roman emperor who became a Christian (whom at that point some called themselves Catholic), despite that religion was persecuted by the Romans for the past 300 years or so. This led to the rise of the Roman Catholics. (Constantine did not start the Roman Catholic religion -since Jesus marks the beginning of Christianity; but that was the start of Roman Catholic movement.)

In 1517, Martin Luter wrote formal complains (protest) regarding how the Roman Catholics were operating. This is the major event that led to the split of the Catholic Church, officially forming the Protestants.

Today, there are many denominations within Christianity. Be it the Catholics, the Roman Catholics, the Protestants, the Baptists, the Methodist, the Reformed Evangelical etc.

And also, I believe there's also this thing known as China's official Christianity.

### Christianity entering China

Oh, but Christianity didn't enter into Japan until the Europeans came. I argue that this line of thought somewhat considers Christianity as a Western religion, which it is not. 

The first recorded Christian missionary to China is attributed to be Alopen in approx 635 AD. However, it is likely that Christianity was already present in India and China much earlier in some form or another (although number of people who believe is unknown).

If Buddhism managed to enter China, and Buddhism managed to get to Japan. Would it be too hard to say that perhaps some form of Christianity entered Japan?

### Hidden Christianity

There is evidences that Christianity was hidden in some Buddhist messages to avoid persecution.

One example that I know of is: the hiding of the motif of Mary, the biological mother of Jesus, in the imagery of Kannon, who is also known as Guan Ying. 

However, that example might have only come out during the Edo period (which makes it in 1500s)). But regardless of when it originated, this is one of the many ways people try to find ways to hide Christian message in different ways.

# Why Christianic Interpretation

## Forward
The interest in studying Iroha from a Christian lens is not because I am trying to attempt to "christianify" the poem or to draw inspiration.

If you believe that it is not Apophenia, -again I repeat; If you believe it is not drawing meaning from randomness, then:

The study of Iroha as a Christian message comes out from three/four parts:
1. The secret message on the right hand side: とかなくてしす which can be interpreted as 咎無くて死す which means "Was sinless, yet died (was killed)."
2. The original structure of the poem is arranged in a 7 row 7 column.
3. The additional potential secret message on the left hand side.
4. The forth one is not really a convincing argument, but there is a third secret message by using the corner letters.

[Skip Why](#finally-christianic-interpretation)

### Why?
#### Sinless, yet died

The Christian message of Jesus, among many things, is:

1. Jesus is sinless. In fact, the only entity to have possession of a human body to have died Sinless.
    * (I was thinking of softening this point so that it is more acceptable to all readers, by writing "if you believe in Christianitic message then this is true". However, this is painfully difficult because the Christians will tell you that this is like trying to argue that "If you believe in gravity then it is gravity exist", which is an unsound argument. )
    * You can argue that Adam and Eve were created before the fall of man, and is therefore sinless. But Adam and Eve were sinless until they ate from "Tree of the knowledge of good and evil", and they died knowing sin. Therefore, Jesus is the only sinless entity. 

2. Jesus was killed. 
    * Jesus was crucified. Whether or not you agree with the Christian message, the crucifixion of Jesus seems to be a historical event.

#### The number SEVEN (7) is a number of religious significance. 

The number 7 has very a strong religious significance in the Bible. It is commonly associated with GOD or Completeness or Eternity. 

Also 7 x 7 sometimes draws to mind from Matthew 18: 22 `Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times."` (Yes, 7 x 7 is different from 77, I know. And I know the other interpretation of the original language is 70 times seven.)

#### Corner letters

I will skip the second secret message on the left hand side to talk about the corner ones because it is related but explaining it this way would be faster.

As I kept emphasizing, if you do not believe this to be Apophenia, then:
* Japan had Manyogana, which is the representing Chinese words using Japanese pronunciation. 
* The Chinese did the same too for Sanskirt. For example 阿弥陀佛, which is `Amitābha`.

##### The name 'Jesus'

Let us examine the name Moses, which is a character in the Bible, from the linguistic point of view.

The Chinese transliteration for Moses (摩西) for example, is Mo-si. In romanized (modern?) Hebrew, it is Moshe.

Now, let us examine the name Jesus from the linguistic point of view.

It is important to know that the word 'Jesus' is the English transliteration of the word Yeshua. In fact reading the word "Yeshua" in English might not even be the proper pronunciation as explored by [Youtuber ReligionForBreakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocWmAg1iaYc). In that video his pronunciation is closer to 'Yesu'.

The thing about 'Yesu' is that, pronouncing it this way sounds like 'iesu', or in Chinese Yesu 耶稣, and in Japanese イエス.

In historical Hiragana, ゑ is read with the phonetic sound of エ (or in Hiragana, え).

So taking the corner letters, (row, column): (1,1), (1,7) and (6,7), you get いゑす which is pronounced as 'iesu'.

Which means you get the following information in no particular order:

[いゑす][とかなくてしす] : [Jesus][was sinless, yet died (was killed)].

<b>However</b>, you will only get this message, if you take "いゑす" and assume it to be in Hebrew, and is also the name. In Japanese "いゑす" doesn't have a meaning. (Again, is this Apophenia?)

#### The additional potential secret message on the left hand side.

There is a secondary "secret" message hidden on the left hand side, which reads: "いちよらやあゑ".

As mentioned 'いゑす' would mean 'Jesus' if and only if you interpret that as Hebrew.

In Japanese, this combination of words いちよらやあゑ doesn't mean anything. 

However, if you read it as Hebrew, you get
- いち would be [אִישׁ](https://ulpan.com/how-to-say-man-in-hebrew/) which means 'Man'
- よら (I've no idea what this is).
- やあゑ is Yahweh which is is GOD.

Which means you get the following information in no particular order:

[いゑす][いち][よら][やあゑ][とかなくてしす] : [Jesus][Man][???][GOD][was sinless, yet died (was killed)].

## Refuting Christianitic significance. 

Now it is important to attempt to refute (deny) possible Christianitic significance of this poem.

1. We don't know who wrote Iroha. 
    * Iroha is attributed to be written by Kuukai (in approx 800 AD)
    * Kuukai is attributed to many things related to Japanese Buddhism. 
        * Infact とかなくてしす is thought to describe something about Kuukai or the author.  
    * `Abe, Ryuichi (1999). The Weaving of Mantra: Kûkai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse. Columbia University Press. ISBN 0-231-11286-6.` argues that it is not Kuukai due to the phonetics. 
    * Supposedly, the first known record of Iroha traces back to around 1000 AD.

2. We can't say for sure that they are influenced by Christianic message.
    * Really we can't.

3. We really don't know if とかなくてしす was actually a coincidence or not. 

4. And all the other possible interpretation of words forming Hebrew words is just could be just apophenia. Such as, the incorrect claim of "Led Zeppelin 'Stairway to Heaven' contains Satanic messages when listened backwards (Backmasking)".

5. If the author really intended Iroha to be read as the 7-5, why not leave it as 7-5?
    * Seven by Seven is just a coincidence or space constrain or something.
    * Maybe it is a writing style.
    * Maybe the writer (may or may not be the author) or the person who copied it, liked it that way.

6. Maybe it is really meant to be interpreted in Manyogana. 

## Now if you assume it is not a coincidence and is really a hidden message

Then take for a second to realize that whoever wrote this is insanely intelligent or had a one time off stroke of genius. 

* It is a pangram (i.e. no letters repeat).
* It contains each Japanese Kana once.
* Unlike the English ABC song, Iroha Uta is a poem that talks about the mortality of life and how you should be pursuing meaningful goals in life.
* It is really useful as an alphabet song if you could make it cyclic (i.e. [by いろは日本語教室](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z72YC7gh2U))
* Looks like something only a Buddhist could think off
* Hid the Christianic message in a subtle enough way that only those who know would know.
* You can easily teach someone this decryption method to get them interested in figuring out what the message of Christianity is about.

# Finally Christianic Interpretation

## Forward:

Whether or not you are of Christian faith, I would like to suggest looking at the verses and seeing how Buddhists who are trying to attain enlightenment might actually view the verses as interesting. 

All verses are taken in from the English Standard Version (ESV).

And in the Buddhist interpretation of Iroha Poem, I talked about how Iroha poem could have a cyclic tune which prompts one to meditate upon the lines over and over again. Because it is eternally repeatable, the moment you hear "Iroha ni", it causes you to reflect on the entire poem and its interpretation, or on each line and its messages. (Ah ok, smelling flowers. What does it mean to smell flowers? Does it really mean 'flowers' here? What other meanings can it be?)

Also it is very possible to argue that "oh you are just misquoting the Bible to prove points without looking at the points before and after". I cannot say that I would not commit this mistake, but I try not to. 

But it is less of proving a point, but rather, what this poem invokes me to think when I think about the poem.

## Big note:

If you, do intend to read on further, know that if you are not of Christian faith, it is possible to find offense at whatever is quoted. Such is the nature of men when his ideals are challenged. 

### To address my Christian brethren

Who would say

> For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. (Romans 1: 19-20)

And who would also say "All truth is GOD's truth".

My reply is: I'm not here to discuss that. 

## Start

Line 1: 色は匂えど 散りぬるを

Line 2: 我が世誰ぞ 常ならん

Line 3: 有為の奥山 今日越えて

Line 4: 浅き夢見じ 酔いもせず

## Line 1 and 2.

First of all, the song draws to my mind:

> A voice says, "Cry!" And I said, "What shall I cry?" All flesh is grass, and all its beauty is like the flower of the field. The grass withers, the flower fades when the breath of the LORD blows on it; surely the people are grass. The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever. (Isaiah 40: 6-8)

Which talks about the mortality of life and things change, except GOD.

And as a comfort

> For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust. As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. (Psalm 103: 14-16)

Which talks about the mortality of life. But GOD remembers that humans are mortals.

> There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death. Even in laughter the heart may ache, and the end of joy may be grief. (Proverbs 14: 12-13)

Which talks about how the glory of man is not necessarily what is good. 

These two lines in Iroha poem also reminds me of The Parable of the Rich Fool. 色は匂えど 散りぬるを 我が世誰ぞ 常ならん.

> And he said to them, "Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions." And he told them a parable, saying, "The land of a rich man produced plentifully, and he thought to himself, 'What shall I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?' And he said, 'I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, `Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.`' But God said to him, 'Fool! This night your soul is required of you, and the things you have prepared, whose will they be?' So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God." (Luke 12: 14-21)

> When you sit down to eat with a ruler, observe carefully what is before you, and put a knife to your throat if you are given to appetite. Do not desire his delicacies, for they are deceptive food. Do not toil to acquire wealth; be discerning enough to desist. When your eyes light on it, it is gone, for suddenly it sprouts wings, flying like an eagle toward heaven. (Proverbs 23: 1-5)

`When your eyes light on it, it is gone, for suddenly it sprouts wings, flying like an eagle toward heaven.` sounds a lot like "When you smell the flowers, it withers" (色は匂えど 散りぬるを)

And lastly, with respect to Line 1 only. 
> Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. (Matthew 24: 42-43)

> Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal. (Matthew 6: 19)

> But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. (2 Peter 3: 8-9)

And with Line 2
> But godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs. (1 Timothy 6: 6-10)

So, what does it mean to smell flowers? And what is the glory of man? What happens when we die? 

Lastly, what about the glory of the LORD?

## Line 3
有為の奥山 今日越えて

And knowing all these, so what? 

> Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart. They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity. But that is not the way you learned Christ!— assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus, to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. (Ephesians 4: 17-24)

有為の奥山 今日越えて. Transient things of the world, today have overcame that. 

> And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise." (Luke 23: 43)

> Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. (John 5: 24)

The anxiousness of the Christian believer: Will I be saved? Will I not be saved?

When you reach the top of the hill and say "I've finally overcome this anxiety", will you relapse and ask "Am I saved?". Surely. 

And knowing all these, so what? 

> Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God. (2 Corinthians 4: 1-6)

(Well, I will agree that the important part of the word "Therefore" is whatever that comes before that, not necessarily after. But that is a different story for another day. )

> So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal. (2 Corinthians 4: 16-18)

色は匂えど 散りぬるを 我が世誰ぞ 常ならん 有為の奥山 今日越えて.

Out self, wasting way. Momentary affliction. Not for my glory, but for the things that are unseen. 

> Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." (John 8: 12)

> You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. (Matthew 5: 14)

You have reached the top of the mountain. You have the light of life. You are the light of the world.

> So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." (John 8: 31-32)

有為の奥山 今日越えて. Transient things of the world, the truth has set me free. 

## Line 4
浅き夢見じ 酔いもせず

> Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. (Ephesians 4: 25)

> But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day." (Acts 2: 14 )

> So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. (2 Timothy 2: 22)

> Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. (1 Peter 5: 8)

> And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5: 18)

> "But watch yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly like a trap."  (Luke 21: 34)

> And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven." And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming." But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts? For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"—he then said to the paralytic—"Rise, pick up your bed and go home." And he rose and went home. When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men. (Matthew 9: 2-8)

## Overall:
> And he said to his disciples, "Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, nor about your body, what you will put on. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds! And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? If then you are not able to do as small a thing as that, why are you anxious about the rest? Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass, which is alive in the field today, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith! And do not seek what you are to eat and what you are to drink, nor be worried. For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them. Instead, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added to you." (Luke 12: 22-31)

> But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness. Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. (1 Timothy 6:11-12)

## TLDR

Well, if you read all of that, first of all, thanks.

If you didn't, it's fine. I wouldn't either.

I feel that some who is practicing some form of asceticstic lifestyle (I'm not talking about any particular kind) might find some of the ideas of the Bible to be fascinating. 

Anyway, TLDR, basically, it is entirely possible to say that whoever wrote/thought of Iroha was inspired by the message brought by the Christian faith. HOWEVER, there is no proof to say that he or she was. 

But, it is interesting to entertain the idea that "とかなくてしす" was not coincidental, and could have been a message about "Jesus who is sinless and is the Son of GOD was crucified".

And how does that affect one's perception when they hear the words

# Iroha nihoheto

which prompts them to meditate:

What does it mean to smell flowers?
